# shootdmonster

99% of code was made by me but learned from a Udemy course.
1% of code, (Master mode and character selection) were made by me.
98% of sprites and sprite costumes are from a Udemy course.
The remaining 2% (The monster blinking animation, master mode switch, demo mouse, playbutton, and monster death) were made by me.
